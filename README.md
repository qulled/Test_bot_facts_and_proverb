# Test_bot_facts_and_proverb
Test creation of a telegram bot
The bot is designed to provide results for the corresponding user requests. The user has three buttons to select a query:
1. Facts (the output of which will contain useful or interesting facts)
2. Useless fact (the conclusion of which will contain a funny or useless fact)
3. Proverb (response to a request in the form of folk wisdom)

The main bot startup file is contained in the file - bot.py ,
an example of data from search queries is - facts.txt , joke_facts.txt and proverb.txt,
and also other files that are necessary to run the bot in the developer environment (the work was tested in PyCharm 2021.3.3).
